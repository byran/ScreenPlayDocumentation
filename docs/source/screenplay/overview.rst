Screen Play Pattern for Python
==============================

.. image:: class_diagram.png


Ability
-------

An ``Ability`` is a class you inherit from to give an ``Actor`` a way to
interact with the system under test.

.. code-block:: python

    from screenplay import Ability, Actor
    from screenplay.behave_extensions import Actors

    class interact_with_the_system(Ability):
        def __init__(self):
            # Initialise object (optional)

        def clean_up(self):
            # Clean up, called when the Actor who
            # has the ability is no longer required

        def do_something(self):
            # Interact with the system

    # ---

    actors = Actors()
    actors.add_person_called('bob').who_can(interact_with_the_system())


Actor
-----

.. code-block:: python

    from screenplay import Actor

    actor = Actor.named('bob')
    actor.can(interact_with_the_system())


**NOTE - This is not how an actor is normally created.
Normally you would use the `behave.Actors.add_person_called(...)` method.**


behave.Actors
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    from screenplay.behave_extensions import Actors
    from abilities.interact_with_the_system import interact_with_the_system

    actors = Actors()
    actors.add_person_called('Bob').who_can(interact_with_the_system())
    actors.switch_active('Bob')

    actors.active.ability(interact_with_the_system).do_something()
    # or if you're using a behave context
    context.they.ability(interact_with_the_system).do_something()


Task
----

.. code-block:: python

    from screenplay import Task, Actor, log_message
    from actions.click_on import click_on

    class search_for_hello_world(Task):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            # Initialise object (optional)

        @log_message('')
        def perform_as(self, actor: Actor):
            actor.perform_as(
                click_on()
                )


Action
------

.. code-block:: python

    from screenplay import Action, Actor, log_message

    class click_on(Action):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            # Initialise object (optional)

        @log_message('click on ...')
        def perform_as(self, actor: Actor):
            # Do something using one of the actors Ability objects


Question
--------

.. code-block:: python

    from screenplay import Question, Actor

    class value_read_from_the_system(Question):
        def answered_by(self, actor: Actor):
            # return a value read using one of the actors Ability objects


Matcher
-------

.. code-block:: python

    from screenplay import Matcher

    class near_one(Matcher):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self._fail_message = 'Value was not near one'

        def matches(self, answer) -> bool:
            return 0.9 < answer < 1.1


Condition
---------

You generally only alias the ``Condition`` class you don't inherit from it.
(e.g. ``see_that`` is an alias of ``Condition``.)

A ``Condition`` constructor takes two parameters:

1. ``question`` - an ``Question`` object that inspects the state of the
   system under test and returns
2. ``expected`` - a ``Matcher`` object to check the result of the question

.. code-block:: python

    from screenplay import see_that, Actor, equals
    from questions import value_read_from_system

    bob = Actor.named('bob')

    bob.should(
        see_that(value_read_from_system(), equals('20'))
        )


Log
---

.. code-block:: python

    from screenplay.log import Log

    # Only log messages from tasks
    Log.to_tasks()

    # Log messages from both tasks and actions
    Log.to_actions()
